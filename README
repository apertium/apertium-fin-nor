# Apertium stuff for Finnish and Norwegian : `apertium-fin-nor`

This is an Apertium language pair for translating between Finnish and Norwegian
(bokmål and nynorsk both). What you can use this language package for:

* Translating between Finnish and Norwegian
* Morphological analysis of Finnish and Norwegian
* Part-of-speech tagging of Finnish and Norwegian

For information on the latter two points, see subheading "For more
information" below.

The dictionary is based on manual work plus a semi-manual conversion from
<https://github.com/giellalt/dict-fin-nob/>, licenced CC BY.

## Requirements

You will need the following software installed:

* lttoolbox (>= 3.3.0)
* apertium (>= 3.3.0)
* vislcg3 (>= 0.9.9.10297)
* hfst (>= 3.8.2)
* apertium-fin
* apertium-nob

If this does not make any sense, we recommend you look at: apertium.org.

## Compiling

Given the requirements being installed, you should be able to just run:

```console
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install
```

You can use `./autogen.sh` instead of `./configure` in case you're compiling
from source. If you installed any prerequisite language packages using a
`--prefix` with `./configure`, make sure to use the same `--prefix` when running
`./configure` here.

## Testing

If you are in the source directory after running make, the following
commands should work:

```console
$ echo "TODO test sentence 1" | apertium -d . fin-nob
TODO test translated sentence 1

$ echo "TODO test sentence 1" | apertium -d . fin-nno
TODO test translated sentence 1

$ echo "TODO test sentence 2" | apertium -d . nob-fin
TODO test translated sentence 2

$ echo "TODO test sentence 2" | apertium -d . nno-fin
TODO test translated sentence 2
```

After installing somewhere in `$PATH`, you should be able to do e.g.

```console
$ echo "TODO test sentence 1" | apertium fin-nob
TODO test translated sentence 1
```
